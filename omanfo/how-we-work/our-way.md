# Our Way: Coordinating Adwoma through the Asafo

This is how Anokye Labs structures and coordinates work. It's opinionated — built from real experience, including mistakes we've made and corrected.

## The Philosophy

We believe in:

1. **Structure over tags** — Use issue types and relationships, not labels
2. **Hierarchy over flatness** — Epic → Feature → Task gives clarity at every level
3. **Automation over ceremony** — Scripts and agents handle the bookkeeping
4. **Verification over assumption** — Always check that the system reflects reality

## Issue Types Are Sacred

At Anokye Labs, every issue must have the correct **type**:

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Epic** | A phase of work or major initiative |
| **Feature** | A cohesive piece that groups related tasks |
| **Task** | A specific, completable work item |
| **Bug** | Something broken |

**These are set via GitHub's organization settings, not labels.** This is the single most important rule. If you see issues with labels like "epic" or "task" instead of actual types, something has gone wrong.

## The Three-Level Hierarchy

### When to Use Three Levels

Use **Epic → Feature → Task** when your Epic has natural groupings:

```
Epic: Phase 2 - Integration
├─ Feature: Core Skill Creation
│  ├─ Task: Analyze existing scripts
│  └─ Task: Create SKILL.md
├─ Feature: Script Conversion (8 tasks)
├─ Feature: Reference Documentation (7 tasks)
└─ Feature: Testing & Validation (2 tasks)
```

This is the right choice when:
- You have 5+ tasks that fall into clear categories
- Features represent distinct deliverables
- Multiple people might work on different features in parallel

### When to Use Two Levels

Use **Epic → Task** when tasks are standalone:

```
Epic: Phase 0 - Setup
├─ Task: Initialize repository
├─ Task: Create directory structure
└─ Task: Write .gitignore
```

This is the right choice when:
- Tasks are independent
- No natural groupings exist
- The phase is simple (setup, config, cleanup)

## Labels: Less Is More

We follow a strict policy on labels:

### ✅ Use Labels For
- **Categorization** — `documentation`, `security`, `performance`
- **Technology** — `powershell`, `typescript`, `graphql`
- **Milestones** — `phase-2-fal-ai` (when GitHub milestones aren't granular enough)
- **Special flags** — `good-first-issue`, `help-wanted`, `breaking-change`

### ❌ Never Use Labels For
- **Issue types** — That's what types are for
- **Relationships** — That's what tasklists are for
- **Status** — That's what issue state and Projects are for
- **Working around missing features** — Find the proper tool

**Rule of thumb:** If you're creating a label to communicate structure, you're using the wrong mechanism.

## Projects as Dashboards

GitHub Projects are for **visualization and tracking**, not for defining relationships:

- Use Projects to see the big picture across issues
- Use custom fields for priority, status, and effort
- Don't confuse Project fields with issue relationships — they're separate systems

## The Agent Workflow

AI agents in our repositories follow a disciplined workflow:

1. **Check the issue** — Every session starts in the context of a GitHub issue
2. **Check dependencies** — Are blocking issues resolved?
3. **Do the work** — Implement what the issue describes
4. **Verify** — Run tests, check behavior
5. **Update the issue** — Report progress, close when done

The [Okyerema skill](../.github/skills/okyerema/SKILL.md) gives agents the technical tools to do all of this correctly.

## Blocking Relationships

GitHub doesn't have native "blocks/blocked by" relationships. We handle this by:

1. **Issue body text** — "**Blocked by:** #7 (Phase 1 must complete first)"
2. **Project fields** — Custom "Blocks" and "Blocked By" text fields
3. **Phase ordering** — Issues within a phase generally depend on prior phases

## Lessons Learned

These rules exist because we made every mistake in the book:

| Mistake | What Happened | What We Do Now |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Used labels for types | Confusion about actual issue types | Use organization types via GraphQL |
| Used title prefixes | `[Epic]` in title doesn't set type | Set type via GraphQL mutation |
| Created flat hierarchies | Epic → 95 Tasks was unmanageable | Use Features to group tasks |
| Used gh CLI | Couldn't set types or relationships | Use GraphQL for all structured ops |
| Expected instant updates | Relationships didn't appear immediately | Wait 2-5 minutes after tasklist changes |
